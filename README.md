#  Student Marks Analyzer using NumPy

A **data analysis project** built entirely with **NumPy** that analyzes student performance across multiple subjects.  
This project includes **data processing, visualization, and report generation** — making it a perfect portfolio-ready Python project.
## Project Overview
The **Student Marks Analyzer** takes a dataset containing:
- Student ID  
- Location  
- Marks in Python, Excel, Power BI, SQL, and English  

It performs:
->Data cleaning & transformation using **NumPy**
->Statistical analysis (mean, max, min, correlation)
->Visualizations (Histogram & Heatmap)
-> Automated **report generation** in a `.txt` file

## Tech Stack
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **NumPy** | Numerical computation & data manipulation |
| **Matplotlib** | Data visualization (histogram & heatmap) |
| **Python (Core)** | File handling and report automation |

## Features
✅ Subject-wise performance (average, max, min)  
✅ Top 5 and Bottom 5 students  
✅ Overall class average  
✅ Correlation between subjects (to see if strong skills in one area link to others)  
✅ Automatic report generation (`report.txt`)  
✅ Saved visualizations (histogram & heatmap)
